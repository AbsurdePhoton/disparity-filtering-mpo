<b>Disparity and depth maps with QT and OpenCV with support for classic image files and MPO stereo pairs</b>
<br/>

<br/>

<b>*** LICENSE</b>
<br/>

The present code is under GPL v3 license, that means you can do almost whatever you want
with it!
I used bits of code from several sources, mainly from the openCV examples
<br/>
<br/>

<b>*** WHY?</b>
<br/>

I didn't find any simple tool (understand: GUI) to produce depth maps from my stereo pictures, and also my camera produces MPO files. So why not writing it myself ?
I'm not an ace of C++ and QT, in fact I only started using them some month ago. So, if you don't find my code pretty never mind, because it WORKS, and that's all I'm asking of it :)
